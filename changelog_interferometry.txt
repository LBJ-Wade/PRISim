from v1.05 of interferometry:
============================

In primary_beams.py,

(*) Added a new function to compute airy disk patterns of uniformly illuminated
circular disks. The funciton is named airy_disk_pattern()
(*) Modified primary_beam_generator() to accept 'hera' for telescope input and 
compute the primary beam using the newly added airy_disk_pattern()
(*) Replaced the use of variable phase_center in all routines with 
pointing_center.

In baseline_delay_horizon.py,

(*) Changed docstring of delay_envelope() to indicate that maximum delay is 
given by [:,:,0]-[:,:,1]

In interferometery.py,

(*) In baseline_generator(), added an input keyword ant_id to keep track of
antennas in the baseline vectors. The output now also contains ids of the 
antenna pair. Docstring changed accordingly
(*) In baseline_generator(), when antenna locations are specified as a numpy
array, baselines were calculated as i-j for j > i. THis is inconsisntent with
baselines if the input was a list of lists where baseliens were calculated as 
j-i for j > i. Now they are all made consistent with j-i for j>i.
(*) Added Tsys initialization from init_file in __init__() member function of
class InterferometerArray
(*) Added a new attribute lag_psf that denotes the inverse fourier transform of
bandpass shape to class InterferometerArray. It is initialized in __init__()
member function and computed in member function delay_transform(). It is saved
using save() member function
(*) Added description of attribute bp_wts to docstring of class
InterferometerArray which was not done earlier
(*) Modified delay_transform() member function of class InterferometerArray to
have output in units of Jy Hz instead of Jy as before. This was done by 
multiplying the IFFT by number of frequency channels (including padded channels, 
if any) and the frequency resolution. This automatically makes the amplitude
invariant to padding and hence no need to correct for amplitudes due to padding
factor at the downsampling step. Hence, the amplitude correction introduced in 
the previous version is now removed.
(*) Replaced use of phase_center in calling primary_beam routines with 
pointing_center to reflect the same changes made in the primary_beam routines.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from v1.04 of interferometry:
============================

In interferometry.py,

(*) Removed the unused attribute sample_density from member function __init__()
of classes Interferometer and InterferometerArray
(*) Added two member functions generate_noise() and add_noise() which generate 
and add noise to the sky visibilities under class InterferometerArray
(*) Removed the computation and addition of noise on visibilities in observe()
member function of class InterferometerArray and moved it to member functions
generate_noise() and add_noise() respectively
(*) Removed a factor 2 while estimating memory_required in member function
observe() of class InterferometerArray. This means size of vis_wts is ignored
since it anyway follows numpy array broadcasting rule
(*) Removed a factor 2 while estimating the downsize_factor if memory shortage 
is detected in observe() member function of class InterferometerArray
(*) memory_required in member function observe() of class InterferometerArray is
now estimated from free+cached+buffer memory instead of only from free memory
(*) In member function delay_transform() of class InterferometerArray, changed
the delay transform to be IFFT instead of FFT to be consistent with the sign 
convention used in creating the visibilities along frequency axis in member 
function observe() and docstring changed accordingly
(*) In member function delay_transform() of class InterferometerArray, replaced
len(self.timestamp) with self.n_acc
(*) In member function save() of class InterferometerArray, now write another
extension to the FITS file containing Tsys information.
(*) In member function save() of class InterferometerArray, now write another
extension to the FITS file containing timestamp information. Timestamps are now
written as 12-character strings
(*) In member function save() of class InterferometerArray, changed the
formatting of writing the extension table containing labels. Labels are now 
written as 5-character strings
(*) In member function __init__() of class InterferometerArray, made changes to
initialization from init_file so it is compatible with output of save() member 
function.
(*) In member function __init__() of class InterferometerArray, made changes to
data type of attributes vis_freq, skyvis_freq, vis_noise_freq, skyvis_lag, 
vis_lag, and vis_noise_lag so they can hold complex values
(*) In member function delay_transform() of class InterferometerArray, padding
with zeros reduced the amplitude and hence the amplitudes are now corrected 
based on the padding factor
(*) Added attributes phase_center and phase_center_coords to class
InterferometerArray. These are updated accordingly in all the member functions
of this class. By default, these are made equal to the pointing center and 
pointing coordinates.
(*) Added member function phase_centering() to rotate visibility phases to any
given phase center.
(*) Phase center information is now saved in save() member function and also
initialized in __init__() member function through init file in class
InterferometerArray. It is also concatenated in member function concatenate().
(*) In member function concatenate() of class InterferometerArray, added the
concatenation of attribute bp_wts which was missing earlier

In primary_beams.py,

(*) Renamed skyunits to skycoords in the dosctring of
isotropic_radiators_array_field_pattern()  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from v1.03 of interferometry:
============================

In interferometery.py,

(*) Added docstring in class InterferometerArray describing the member function
observing_run()
(*) Made minor corrections in print statements and docstrings inside the class
InterferometerArray to indicate they belong to that class and not the class
Interferoemter.
(*) Enabled __init__() member function of class InterferometerArray to initialize
from data in a file through the input parameter init_file which may have been 
created using the save() member function
(*) In member function save() of class InterferometerArray, now save the
attribute skycoords as a keyword in the primary header.
(*) In member function save() of class InterferometerArray, now save the
attribute keywords bp_wts and labels as separate extensions
(*) Following up with the change in the nature of attribute frequency in class
Catalog in the module catalog.py under the class of "general" modules, its usage
is now modified to reflect its nature as an array in both classes Interferometer
and InterferometerArray
(*) Modified error checking in __init__() member function of class
InterferometerArray to be compatible with initializing from input arguments or 
from init_file
(*) Tweaked a few places in member function observe() of class 
InterferoemterArray to have numpy array broadcasting compatibility
(*) In member function save() of class InterferometerArray, the baseline labels 
are now saved as a binary table extension instead of an image table used before
because the labels are strings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from v1.02 of interferometry:
============================

In interferometry.py,

(*) In member function observe() of class Interferometer, removed the product by
the bandpass function in determining the sky visibilities and subsequently the
measured visibilities. Instead bandpass is kept seprate and can be modified or
applied as per need.
(*) In member function delay_transform() of class Interferometer, bandpass shape
is multiplied to the visibilities in the frequency domain before computing the
delay transform.
(*) In member function save() of class Interferometer, the bandpass shapes as a
function of snapshot instance and frequency are saved in an extension as an
array.
(*) In member function save() of class Interferometer, the LST and pointing
centers are stored as an extension table
(*) In class Interferometer, added description of member function observing_run()
to the docstring. Renamed mention of noise_estimate() in the docstring of class
Interferometer to band_averaged_noise_estimate()
(*) In class Interferometer, modified the description of class attribute bp in 
the docstring
(*) In class Interferometer's __init__() and observing_run() member functions, 
changed from 'channels *= ...' to 'channels = channels * ...' because the former
modifies the original input argument as well due to passing by reference 
(*) In member function observing_run() of class Interferometer, commented the
usage of milestones and printing of progress percentage and replaced it with use
of the progressbar module.
(*) In member function delay_transform() of class Interferometer, added input 
arguments, namely, pad and verbose to the function. pad provides a padding before
the delay transform and also determines the downsampling factor of the delay
spectrum after the delay transform. Setting verbose prints diagnostic and
progress messages.
(*) Added a new attribute bp_wts to class Interferometer. This attribute is to
serve the purpose of any additional frequency weighting on top of the inherent
bandpass shape, represented by the attribute bp.
(*) Added an input parameter 'freq_wts' to member function delay_transform() of
class Interferometer which denotes the additional frequency weighting to be
applied in additional to the inherent bandpass shape while performing the delay
transform. The attribute bp_wts is assigned with this freq_wts.
(*) Modified member function __init__() of class Interferometer to intialize the
newly included attribute bp_wts
(*) Modified member function observe() of class Interferometer to build a default
set of frequency weights (all unity) and assigned to the attribute bp_wts
(*) Modified the docstrings of class Interferometer to note the inclusion of this
new attribute bp_wts.
(*) Modified member function observe() of class Interferometer to incorporate more
of python numpy concept of broadcasting of arrays 

(*) Added a new class InterferometerArray which is a significant enhancement over
the class Interferometer. The former can handle multiple baselines whereas the 
latter can handle only one baseline at a time. The former also has some memory
optimization strategies built in including the efficient numpy broadcasting of
arrays. In addition, this class is not limited to compact foreground models but
can also handle extended structures by approximating them with circular gaussian
profiles in the image domain and corresponding visibility weights in the aperture 
plane.

(*) From here on, class InterferometerArray supercedes the functionality of class
Interferoemter and hence, the latter will not be developed any further. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from v1.01 of interferometry:
============================

In primary_beams.py,

(*) Vectorized the routines so a vector of frequencies/wavelengths can be handled
all at once.
(*) Changed docstrings to reflect the vectorized capabilities
(*) Modified isotropic_radiators_array_field_pattern() so it can handle well
numerically angles very close to zero.
(*) Modified primary_beam_generator() to include a telescope system where only a
MWA dipole is used ignoring the dipole array pattern in a tile. 

In interferometry.py,

(*) In member functions observe() and observing_run() of class Interferometer,
renamed the input parameter fov_radius to roi_radius.
(*) In member functions observe() and observing_run() of class Interferometer,
added a new input parameter roi_center which defines the center around which
roi_radius is to be used.
(*) In member function observe() of class Interferometer, replaced temporary
variable ptmp which changes reference from Alt-Az to direction cosines with
two meaningful variables pc_altaz and pc_dircos.
(*) In member function observe() of class Interferometer, replaced usage of 
len(d12) with len(m2) for an easy accommodation of cases where
roi_center='zenith'
(*) In member function observe() of class Interferometer, replaced usage of 
internal variable phase_center with pc_altaz because they are identical and
removed the redundant definition of phase_center
(*) In member function observe() of class Interferometer, replaced usage of 
source_positions with skypos_altaz_roi
(*) In member function observe() of class Interferometer, if input parameter
roi_center is set to 'zenith', the source positions in the catalog are converted
to Alt-Az coordinates and numpy's where() function selects sources in the region
of interest instead of using computationally expensive spherematch() function 
from geometry module. However, in such a scenario, if the catalog's coordinates
are not in Alt-Az coordinate system, every call of observe() will invoke a 
conversion of the entire catalog to Alt-Az coordinate system.
(*) Modified the docstring of member function observe() of class Interferometer
(*) Added docstring to member function observing_run() of class Interferometer
(*) Modified certain parts inside member function observe() of class
interferometer to take advantage of the vectorized primary_beam codes
(*) Added input parameter brightness_temperature to member functions observe()
and observing_run() of class Interferometer to denote the units of flux density
which can now be 'K' (Kelvin) or 'Jy' (Jansky)
(*) Added an attribute flux_unit for class Interferometer which denotes the unit 
of flux density (either 'K' for Kelvin or 'Jy' for Jansky)
(*) Member function save() of class Interferometer saves the attribute flux_unit
onto the header of the output FITS file.
(*) Fixed save() member function of class Interferometer to write out t_acc and
vis_rms_freq by modifying the criterion checking for empty lists
(*) Modified docstring of class Interferometer to indicate that the telescope 
attribute can also be set to 'mwa_dipole' in addition to the already existing
options such as 'vla', 'gmrt', and 'mwa'.

In VLA_simulation.py,

(*) Replaced the occurrence of fov_radius with roi_radius

In MWA_simulation.py,

(*) Replaced the occurrence of fov_radius with roi_radius

In MWA_observing_run_simulation.py,

(*) Replaced the occurrence of fov_radius with roi_radius
(*) Ensured that catalog frequency and observing frequency are passed to the 
observing member function(s) in class Interferometer in the same units

Created a new file observing_run_test_cases.py which simulates many test cases
sampling different parameters such as observing parameters, foreground models, 
etc.

center (refer to changes in isotropic_radiators_array_field_pattern() in 
primary_beams.py)
(*) Moved the routine baseline_generator from geometry.py to interferometry.py

In primary_beams.py,

(*) Added docstring to all functions
