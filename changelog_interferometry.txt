from v1.0 of interferometry:
===========================

In interferometry.py,

(*) Added a member function band_averaged_noise_estimate() to class
Interferometer.
(*) Corrected the thermal noise rms formula. It was missing a square root for 
the observing time and frequency width
(*) Added docstring to the class Interferometer and all its member functions
(*) Removed unused attrbute obs_catalog
(*) Remove unused attribute pb
(*) Ensured that input parameter skymodel to member function observe() of class
Interferometer is an instance of class Catalog.
(*) Remove unused input pb_min to member function observe() of class 
Interferometer
(*) In member function observe(), made a correction to the geometric
transformation from Alt-Az coordinates to HA-Dec by using LST only for the HA
and not on Dec after the altaz2hadec() transformation in the geometry module
(*) Added a member function observing_run() that can simulate an observing run 
in drift or tracking mode.
(*) Added a member function save() to save the interferometer information onto 
a FITS file on disk
(*) Modified attribute tobs to t_acc (accumulation time) and added t_obs to 
denote observing run duration
(*) Added attribute n_acc to denote the number of accumulations
(*) Inserted initializing statements for t_acc, t_obs, and n_acc
(*) Corrected a 'and' to 'or' in the implementation of frequency scale when 
given in Hz.
(*) In call to primary_beam_generator(), also added an argument to specify phase
center (refer to changes in isotropic_radiators_array_field_pattern() in 
primary_beams.py)
(*) Moved the routine baseline_generator from geometry.py to interferometry.py

In primary_beams.py,

(*) Added docstring to all functions
(*) Made corrections to validation of direction cosines in function 
isotropic_radiators_array_field_pattern()
(*) Added capability to include a phase center and compute primary beams 
relative to this phase center. Correspondingly, added another keyword input
phase_center to isotropic_radiators_array_field_pattern() and to
primary_beam_generator()

In baseline_delay_horizon.py,

(*) Changed explanation of the returned variable delaymatrix in the docstring
of delay_envelope() to remove ambiguity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from v1.2 of python-trials:
==========================

In baseline_delay_horizon.py,

(*) changed global c (speed of light) to FCNST.c where FCNST is the
scipy.constants module
